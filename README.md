Objective: Studying VHDL design flow

## Section 1 
Exercise1 - Create VHDL solution proposal (logical OR with 3 inputs) using the syntax when...else, process...case, and with...select
NOTE: create a different files.

Exercise2 - Create VHDL solution proposal (Decoder3x8) using logic gates, concurrent assignment, WHEN ... ELSE, IF within PROCESS, and CASE within PROCESS
NOTE: each in different files. These files will be used later.

Exercise3 - Create VHDL solution proposal (adder and subtractor 4-bit, NO SIGNAL and 12-bits multiplier of a number of 2 numbers).
NOTE: create a different files.

## Section 2 
Exercise1 - Create new project for MODELSIM, a process to generate non-periodic signal for an 8-bit vector (passing the following values ​​every 10ns) : “ZZZZ_ZZZZ”
"0000_0000" "1010_0100" "ZZZZ_ZZZZ"
NOTE: Simulate with an appropriate time base (100 ns).

Exercise2 - Create VHDL solution proposal for EXAMPLE 2 and its respective testbench.

Exercise3 - Use all VHDL solution proposals (Decoder3x8) and create its respective testbench.

## Section 3 
Exercise1 - Create VHDL solution proposal (Shift registers) FOR...LOOP and WHILE...LOOP.

Exercise2 - Creat the Logical diagram resulting from the VHDL code below
```VHDL
process(clk, rst)
begin
	if rst = '1' then
		q_a <= (others=>'0'); 
	elsif clk'event and clk = '1' then
		if en = '1' then
			q_a(0) <= d;
			q_a(7 downto 1) <= q_a(6 downto 0);
		end if;
	end if;
end process;

sr_output <= q_a(seletor);
```

Exercise3 - Describe the state machine in the following diagram (with counters,Fifo Synchronous and Generic thresholds).

Design Kit Hands-On
https://youtu.be/RlrAdS8eaxc

Exemple1 - Use the switches and LEDS to implement a circuit that turns the LED on/off with the change of state of each one of them.

Exercise1 - Change the previous resolution to a new LED vector(5 positions), check each pin mapping on Altera pinplanner and Map this new element. NOTE: verify technical documentation and user guide.

Exemple2 - Create VHDL solution proposal for simple counter

Exercise2 - Use the switches to verify Decoder3x8 VHDL implementation (Exercise3-section3)

Exercise3 - Justify why the counter uses 29-bits

Exercise4 - Create VHDL solution proposal (4-bit counter), Selector switch for UP and DOWN, Push button to increase/decrease according to configuration
LOAD button, loads the counter with key value and turn on the counter on LEDs.
Note: use counterupdown.zip design reference

## Section 8 
Use previous Design Kit documentation

Exercise1 - Create VHDL solution proposal for COUNTER project and add a PLL(Altera IP) on it design - Include one counter for each clock.
The PLL must have 4 outputs: C0(PLL_out) - clock converter 50MHz to 125MHz, C1(PLL_out) - clock converter 50MHz to 100MHz, c2(PLL_out) - clock converter 50MHz to 25MHz and c3(PLL_out) - clock converter 50MHz to 10MHz.
